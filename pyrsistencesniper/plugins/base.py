# Plugins filter at two levels, and the split is load-bearing.
#   run(): reject values that are not valid findings at all - garbage data,
#     non-executable flags, wrong value types. This is data quality, and nothing
#     dropped here can be recovered with --min-severity.
#   Detection profile allow/block rules: suppress values that are valid
#     persistence entries but known-good defaults (explorer.exe for
#     winlogon_shell). This is policy, and --min-severity info shows it again.
# Suppress inside run() only when no evidence could make the value a finding.
